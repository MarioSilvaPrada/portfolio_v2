  My goal is always to write clean and readable code where not just me but also the client can easily maintain it to proper fit into a specific profile. I'm also passionate
  to implement beautiful User Interface(UI) & User Experience(UX). My projects will work and look good on any device, no matter the size of the screen.`,
  technologies: `As a developer I try to be agnostic regarding chosen technologies. However, there are some of them that brings me more joy to work with and as a 
  result, I can present well-structured and completed products. React along with Redux and Typescript allow me to create beautiful User Interface in a clean and 
  elegant way. In the other side, Django and Django Rest Framework offers an excellent way to build a solid server side logic with everything you need to feed your frontend.`,
