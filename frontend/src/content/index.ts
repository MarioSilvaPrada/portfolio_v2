  services: `Let's face it, development tends to be complex sometimes, and is for that reason I like to research and plan to deliver the best results to my clients. 
  My goal is always to write clean and readable code, where not just me but also the client can easily maintain it to properly fit into a specific profile. I'm also 
  passionate to implement beautiful User Interface(UI) & User Experience(UX). My projects will work and look good on any device, no matter the size of the screen.`,
  technologies: `As a developer, I try to be agnostic regarding chosen technologies. However, some of them bring me more joy to work with and as result, I can present 
  well-structured and completed products. React along with Redux and Typescript allow me to create a beautiful User Interface cleanly and elegantly. On the other side, 
  Django and Django Rest Framework offers an excellent way to build a solid server-side logic with everything you need to feed your frontend.`,
